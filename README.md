# MC TradeUps
A Minecraft plugin concept for GUI-based item trading between two players.

> ⚠️ **This is a concept project.** The code was written quickly to validate the idea, not structured as a final production-ready plugin.  
> No testing was done for duplication exploits or edge cases like multi-user concurrency. Use at your own risk.

## ✨ Features

- `/trade <player>` command to request trades
- Chat buttons to accept or deny trades
- Inventory-based trading interface (separate sides for each player)
- Trade confirmation and status feedback
- Admin logging with timestamps
- Auto-expiring requests
- Player disconnection safety
